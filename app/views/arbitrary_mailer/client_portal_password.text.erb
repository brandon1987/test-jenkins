Dear <%=@customername%>,

<%=@companyname%> has added your company to their client portal on ConstructionManager.Net
You can use it to view details of their operations which they have shared with you.

The client portal can be accessed from www.constructionmanager.net/clientportal


Before you will be able to use the client portal, you will need to set up a username and password. To do this, visit the address below to complete the registration process.


http://constructionmanager.net/clientportal/registration?invite=<%=@invite_code%>


This link will be usable once, and will expire after 7 days, if you forget your password you can reset it from the client portal page.

Thanks, and we look forward to seeing you online!
